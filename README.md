ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PrototypeDEV23 
I'am learning Python as my main programming language, 
but i will learn some programming language that have been used
in Back end jobs so that i can code websites.

I did some small python project though, you can check them out

If you have suggestions or project that i will be interested in
Email me chaincrafter202@gmail.com, so we can work on that
